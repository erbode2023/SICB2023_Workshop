# SICB2023 Workshop - Exploring -omics beyond assembly and general annotation for non-model organisms"

Information and materials for SICB 2023's "Exploring -omics beyond assembly and general annotation for non-model organisms" workshop. 

The goal of this NSF-funded workshop is to conduct hands-on training sessions for researchers in utilizing -omics data beyond the initial stages of assembly, summary stats, and basic BLAST-based annotations. Towards that purpose, speakers will lead sessions, where they train participants to use custom pipelines, databases, or applications that harness the strengths of transcriptomic/genomic/phenomic datasets.

Topics covered: data mining strategies to build refined phylogenetic trees; orthology inference for phylogenomics and downstream applications, such as determining positive selection; revise subset of the Pfam database using a user-defined taxonomic pool through TIAMMAt.
